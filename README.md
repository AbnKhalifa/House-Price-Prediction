# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts house prices using various regression models on the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Given features such as overall quality, area, year built, garage size, and neighborhood, the goal is to predict the house sale price.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
  Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for Random Forest and other models.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Add interaction features, polynomial features, or domain-specific transformations that could improve model performance.

- **Outlier Detection & Removal**  
  Analyze features like `GrLivArea`, `LotArea`, and `SalePrice` for extreme values that could negatively impact learning.

- **Target Transformation**  
  Apply log transformation to `SalePrice` to handle skewness and improve prediction accuracy.

- **Use Advanced Models**  
  Test more powerful regressors like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost for better accuracy and speed.

- **Cross-Validation**  
  Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well across different subsets of the data.

- **Model Deployment**  
  Deploy the best model using Flask or Streamlit as a web application to demonstrate real-world usage.

- **Feature Importance Visualization**  
  Create SHAP or permutation-based importance plots to understand the model's decision-making process.
